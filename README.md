# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the core functionalities of a booking platform like Airbnb. This project aims to provide hands-on experience in building a scalable, secure, and efficient web application using modern software development practices. It focuses on backend architecture, database design, API development, application security, and CI/CD pipeline integration.

## Project Goals
- Build a robust and scalable booking platform with features such as user authentication, property listings, booking management, and secure transactions.
- Enhance collaborative development skills using GitHub for version control and team coordination.
- Design and implement a relational database to support real-world booking scenarios.
- Build secure APIs adhering to industry-standard security practices.
- Automate deployment processes with CI/CD pipelines for efficient development cycles.
- Document and plan the project to align with industry-grade software development standards.


## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Django (Python framework for rapid development and clean design)
- **Database**: MySQL (Relational database for structured data storage)
- **API**: GraphQL (Flexible query language for efficient data retrieval)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (For automated testing and deployment)
- **Containerization**: Docker (For consistent development and production environments)
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub (For collaborative development and code management)

This repository will include project milestones that are required by ALX.
