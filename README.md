# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the core functionalities of a booking platform like Airbnb. This project aims to provide hands-on experience in building a scalable, secure, and efficient web application using modern software development practices. It focuses on backend architecture, database design, API development, application security, and CI/CD pipeline integration.

## Project Goals
- Build a robust and scalable booking platform with features such as user authentication, property listings, booking management, and secure transactions.
- Enhance collaborative development skills using GitHub for version control and team coordination.
- Design and implement a relational database to support real-world booking scenarios.
- Build secure APIs adhering to industry-standard security practices.
- Automate deployment processes with CI/CD pipelines for efficient development cycles.
- Document and plan the project to align with industry-grade software development standards.

## Team Roles
In this section, I list all the roles involved in the development of this Airbnb Clone project and their key responsibilities:

### Product Owner (PO)
The PO is responsible for the overall vision of the project. They define what the final product should do based on customer needs and market demand, and prioritize features for the team.

### Business Analyst (BA)
The BA acts as the bridge between the client and the development team. They analyze the business needs, gather requirements, and translate them into technical tasks for developers.

### Backend Developer
The BE developer is responsible for building the core logic of the app, such as user authentication, booking functionality, and connecting to the database. They ensure the app works smoothly behind the scenes.

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Administrator (DBA)
The DBA designs and manages the structure of the database. Ensures that data like user profiles, listings, and bookings are stored efficiently, securely, and can be easily accessed by the backend.

### UI/UX Designer
The UI/UX designer creates the look and feel of the application. They make sure the website is user-friendly, visually appealing, and provides a smooth experience to the users.

### QA Engineer (Quality Assurance)
The QAE tests the website to make sure everything works correctly and meets the project requirements. They catch bugs before the app goes live.

### Test Automation Engineer
The TAE writes code to automatically test the application‚Äôs key features. This helps ensure fast and reliable testing, especially after updates or new features.

### ‚öôDevOps Engineer
The DevOps engineer handles deployment and server-side infrastructure. They help the team release updates faster and keep the app running reliably using CI/CD pipelines and monitoring tools.

### Project Manager (PM)
The PM coordinates the project timeline, makes sure tasks are completed on time, and manages communication among the team. They ensure that the team stays on track and within budget.
