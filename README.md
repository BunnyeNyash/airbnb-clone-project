# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the core functionalities of a booking platform called Airbnb. This project aims to provide hands-on experience in building a scalable, secure, and efficient web application using modern software development practices. It focuses on backend architecture, database design, API development, application security, and CI/CD pipeline integration.

## Project Goals
- Build a robust and scalable booking platform with features such as user authentication, property listings, booking management, and secure transactions.
- Enhance collaborative development skills using GitHub for version control and team coordination.
- Design and implement a relational database to support real-world booking scenarios.
- Build secure APIs adhering to industry-standard security practices.
- Automate deployment processes with CI/CD pipelines for efficient development cycles.
- Document and plan the project to align with industry-grade software development standards.

## Feature Breakdown

This section holds a breakdown of the main features that will be in the Airbnb clone and how each contributes to the project.

### 1. **User Management**
This will handle the registrations, authentications, and profile management for both the hotel owners and the customers. This feature ensures that only verified users can list properties or make bookings, maintaining the integrity and security of the platform.

### 2. **Property Management**
This enables the hotel owners to create, update, and manage property listings. Each listing will contain essential details such as title of the property, description of the property, the pricing, and the location, forming the core of the booking system.

### 3. **Booking System**
This allows the customers to reserve available properties for specific dates, manage their booking details, and track upcoming stays. It ensures availability is respected and handles user check-in and check-out dates.

### 4. **Payment Processing**
This integrates a secure payment system to handle financial transactions related to bookings. It records payment details and statuses to ensure transparency and accountability between the customers and the hotel owners.

### 5. **Review System**
This gives the customers the ability to leave reviews and rate their stays, fostering trust among users. This also helps maintain high-quality listings by providing feedback to hotel owners and future customers.

### 6. **API Integration (REST & GraphQL)**
This provides both RESTful and GraphQL APIs for interacting with the backend. This dual API approach offers flexibility and ease of integration for various frontend clients or third-party services.

### 7. **Database Optimization**
This makes use of indexing and caching strategies to improve data retrieval speeds and reduce server load. It is crucial for maintaining performance as the platform scales with more users and data.


## API Security
There needs to be security measures that secures the backend APIs as the platform will handle sensitive user data, financial transactions, and property information, and listed below are some of the measures to be put in place. The measures will ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and system availability.

### 1. **Authentication**
Only registered users can access certain endpoints, and secure authentication mechanisms will be used. This will ensure that users are who they claim to be and prevents unauthorized access to accounts or data.

### 2. **Authorization**
Role-based access controls will be implemented to restrict actions based on user roles. This will prevent the users from performing unauthorized operations, such as modifying other users‚Äô data or managing properties they do not own.

### 3. **Rate Limiting**
This will limit the number of API requests a user or IP address can make within a certain timeframe. This will help protect the system against abuse, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and brute-force attempts.

### 4. **Data Validation & Sanitization**
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection or XSS. This will ensure only clean, expected data is processed and stored.

### 5. **HTTPS Enforcement**
All API traffic will be encrypted using HTTPS to protect data in transit from interception and tampering. This is especially crucial for protecting login credentials and payment details.

### 6. **Secure Payment Handling**
Sensitive payment information will not be stored directly, hence payment processing will be handled through secure third-party gateways that comply with industry standards. This will ensure that user financial data is protected and minimizes legal liabilities.

### Why Security Matters
- **User Data Protection**: Ensures personal details like emails, passwords, and IDs are kept safe.
- **Property & Booking Integrity**: Prevents unauthorized changes to listings or bookings.
- **Financial Safety**: Secures payment transactions and reduces the risk of fraud or data breaches.
- **Platform Trust**: A secure platform builds user confidence and long-term credibility.
